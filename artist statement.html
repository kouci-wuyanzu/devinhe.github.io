<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p> I would like to describe my artwork as disorganized, which means I don’t have stable styles of my artwork, and I also don’t have a stable staff.  I like to draw characters, form and reproduce some pictures for practice. That you can see my artwork is always in a different style, and even people might not know those works are made by the same author. However, I have something that I like very much and want to try in my artwork. There are sketches and mechanical style. I like white, black, or gray those cleanly and concise colors, sketches can show these concise colors very well therefore my aesthetic is concise, and cleanly. <br>
   I have 5 sketch works, Two are drawing, building and landscape design. Tow is shaped graphics. I finish them with different type pencils, and I like the light value. As I created these drawings, I was thinking about how to make the light value show strongly, not just a white color. There are color gradients shown on the shape, the origin color, lightness color and brightness color. For the landscape sketch work, I want to draw an island town and begin the ocean line, and I also want to draw a beach. However the result is I drew a mountant show on the ocean, this inspiration is from when I travel to Greece, they have some famous islands in the Mediterranean; that only surround the ocean and the native people builded up many observation decks; I saw many nice landscapes right there. Therefore I want to show off the ocean and island town in my artwork. Most sketches only have the colors between black and white, that like water, glass or plastic are very hard to show their element. 
  Basic on my sketch works, my overall vision and connection with digital media art and photography. Digital image is very different from the sketch, I still do not have an idea for doing that. I think I still need some time for learning digital media art, there are too many things I never saw before but I am still doing some digital image work to practice and doing the assignment. <br>
  For my digital portfolio, those artworks are all my assignments, but my creating ideas and inspirations are from my favorite stuff. Such as the image composition, the main character is from my favorite animate “One Piece”, and I follow his ability in the animation. I like this character, therefore I create it in my composition image. I also use other “One Piece” stuff in the first website. As my 3D model, the inspiration is from the gun fire videogames and I choose different gun’s components then combine them together. When I do my glitch images, I don’t have good inspiration, but I still make some effects that make the images look like digital electronics. 
    I believe my digital media art needs more time to develop it, therefore I would like to say my digital media artwork is not my want and I want to create it really owner work. I also want to find more inspiration in my daily life and the stuff I can always see.
